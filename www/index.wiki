<h3>About QLFossil</h3>

QLFossil is a Quick Look plugin for Mac OS X to display 
[http://www.fossil-scm.org | Fossil] repositories. It displays repository 
name and description, and timeline in Quick Look thumbnails and previews.

IDs of events have different background colors:
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr>
<td bgcolor=#CCF>check-ins</td>
<td bgcolor=#CF6>tickets</td>
<td bgcolor=#FC6>wiki events</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Download</h3>

[http://c0043312.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/QLFossil.zip | QLFossil.zip] (17 KB, Version 1.1)

<h3>Installation</h3>

Unzip, then copy <i>QLFossil.qlgenerator</i> to <i>~/Library/QuickLook/</i> (create this
folder if it doesn't exist) or <i>/Library/QuickLook/</i>. Probably, you'll
need to restart your Mac.

<b>Requirements:</b> QLFossil should be compatible with Mac OS X 10.5 and later,
 however it's only tested on Mac OS X 10.6. It doesn't require fossil to be
 installed, it reads data directly from repositories.

<h3>Usage</h3>

Locate Fossil repository (not working copy!) in Finder and press Space. BOOM!

QLFossil understands repositories with <i>.fossil</i> and <i>.fsl</i>
extensions. Currently it doesn't know anything about tags or branches, it displays just a dumb timeline of events.
